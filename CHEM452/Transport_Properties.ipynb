This can be accomplished by simply dividing by the integral of the distribution function. (If that is not clear, think of how we normalized the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We multiplied by a constant and integrated over the entire range of the variables and set equal to 1. Solving for the constant of normalization means dividing 1 by the integral. So the normalization constant is really just the reciprocal of the integral.)
