These graphs result in complete descriptions of how things change but, consisting solely of lists of numbers, it can be difficult, especially as the mechanisms get more complicated, to accuratly describe or predict the differences expected between similar mechanisms.\n",
        "In addition to numerically solving for the concentrations, it is also possible to apply one of two major approximations and get symbolic results.\n",
        "##Equilibrium approximation\n",
        "If a later step in the mechanism is slow (rate determining) and an earlier step is an equilibrium, the rate law overall will be the rate law of the slow step which will almost certainly contain an intermediate. The equilibrium approximation is applied by assuming that equilibrium for the early step is achieved and so the concentration of the intermediate can be determined in terms of the reactants.\n",

        "For a first-order reaction, A$\\rightleftharpoons$B$\\rightarrow$C, having forward and backward rate constants of $k_1$ and $k_{-1}$ and a second step rate constant of $k_2$ which will be small, if equilibrium is estabilished, $k_1[A]=k_{-1}[B]$ so the intermediate [B] will have a concentration of $[B]=\\dfrac{k_1[A]}{k_{-1}}$ and the reaction will have an overall rate determined from the second step of $$rate=k_2[B]=k_2\\dfrac{k_1[A]}{k_{-1}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course the second step does not have a rate of zero so the first step does not truly reach equilibrium and the concentration of [B] is presumably zero at the beginning whereas the approximation suggests that it is always some non-zero fraction of [A]. However, for reactions that have a slow step after an equilibrium step, this approximation is likely a reasonable one.\n",
        "\n",
        "The equilibrium approximation is also called the pre-equilibrium approximation or the prior-equilibrium approximation to suggest that the equilibruim occurs prior to the rate determining step.\n",

        "## Steady-state approximation\n",
        "In the opposite case where slow step occurs first, an appropriate approximation would assume that all the intermediate gets used as soon as it is formed so the rate of formation of intermediate is effectively zero. For a first-order reaction, A$\\rightleftharpoons$B$\\rightarrow$C, having forward and backward rate constants of $k_1$ and $k_{-1}$ and a second step rate constant of $k_2$ the steady-state approximation would indicate that $$\\dfrac{d[B]}{dt}=k_1[A]-k_{-1}[B]-k_2[B]≈0 $$\n",

        "The steady-state approximation does not require that the formation of product is fast; it only requires that the intermediate not change significantly in concentration. If the backwards first step is fast and removes the intermediate as quickly as soon as it's formed, that's good enough. In this way the steady-state approximation also fits some cases covered by the equilibrium approximation.\n",
