In this method we will turn the function $\\psi(x)$ into a vector, which is a list in Python, and the operator of the differential equation into a *matrix*.

We thus have $N$ values $x_i$, which have a stepsize $h = \\Delta x = x_{i+1} - x_i$. Our choice of the *size* of our space, $N$, turns out to be important. Too large a number will slow down our computation and require too much computer memory, too small a number and the answers we compute will not be sufficiently accurate. A common practice is to start with a small number $N$ and then increase it until the accuracy is acceptable. The actual value you obtain in the end will depend on the problem you are studying.\n",

There are other possible ways to do a finite difference but we won't concern ourselves with them here.\n",
